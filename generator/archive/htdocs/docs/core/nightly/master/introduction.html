<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Hyperledger Sawtooth is an enterprise blockchain platform for building
distributed ledger applications and networks. The design philosophy targets
keeping ledgers <em>distributed</em> and making smart contracts <em>safe</em>, particularly
for enterprise use.</p>
<p>Sawtooth simplifies blockchain application development by separating the core
system from the application domain. Application developers can specify the
business rules appropriate for their application, using the language of their
choice, without needing to know the underlying design of the core system.</p>
<p>Sawtooth is also highly modular. This modularity enables enterprises and
consortia to make policy decisions that they are best equipped to make.
Sawtooth’s core design allows applications to choose the transaction rules,
permissioning, and consensus algorithms that support their unique business
needs.</p>
<p>Sawtooth is an open source project under the Hyperledger umbrella. For
information on how to contribute, see <a class="reference internal" href="#join-the-sawtooth-community">Join the Sawtooth Community</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="about-distributed-ledgers">
<h2>About Distributed Ledgers<a class="headerlink" href="#about-distributed-ledgers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A “distributed ledger” is another term for a blockchain. It distributes a
database (a ledger) of transactions to all participants in a network (also
called “peers” or “nodes”). There is no central administrator or centralised
data storage. In essence, it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Distributed</strong>: The blockchain database is shared among potentially
untrusted participants and is demonstrably identical on all nodes
in the network. All participants have the same information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Immutable</strong>: The blockchain database is an unalterable history of all
transactions that uses block hashes to make it easy to detect and
prevent attempts to alter the history.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure</strong>: All changes are performed by transactions that are signed by
known identities.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>These features work together, along with agreed-upon consensus mechanisms, to
provide “adversarial trust” among all participants in a blockchain network.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="distinctive-features-of-sawtooth">
<h2>Distinctive Features of Sawtooth<a class="headerlink" href="#distinctive-features-of-sawtooth" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="separation-between-the-application-level-and-the-core-system">
<h3>Separation Between the Application Level and the Core System<a class="headerlink" href="#separation-between-the-application-level-and-the-core-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sawtooth makes it easy to develop and deploy an application by providing a
clear separation between the application level and the core system level.
Sawtooth provides smart contract abstraction that allows application
developers to write contract logic in a language of their choice.</p>
<p>An application can be a native business logic or a smart contract virtual
machine. In fact, both types of applications can co-exist on the same
blockchain. Sawtooth allows these design decisions to be made in the
transaction-processing layer, which allows multiple types of applications to
exist in the same instance of the blockchain network.</p>
<p>Each application defines the custom
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-transaction-processor"><span class="xref std std-term">transaction processors</span></a> for its unique
requirements. Sawtooth provides several example
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-transaction-family"><span class="xref std std-term">transaction families</span></a> to serve as models for
low-level functions (such as maintaining chain-wide settings and storing
on-chain permissions) and for specific applications such as performance
analysis and storing block information.</p>
<p>Transaction processor SDKs are available in multiple languages to streamline
creation of new contract languages, including Python, JavaScript, Go, C++,
Java, and Rust. A provided REST API simplifies client development by
adapting <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-validator"><span class="xref std std-term">validator</span></a> communication to standard HTTP/JSON.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="private-networks-with-the-sawtooth-permissioning-features">
<h3>Private Networks with the Sawtooth Permissioning Features<a class="headerlink" href="#private-networks-with-the-sawtooth-permissioning-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sawtooth is built to solve the challenges of permissioned (private) networks.
Clusters of Sawtooth nodes can be easily deployed with separate permissioning.
There is no centralized service that could potentially leak transaction
patterns or other confidential information.</p>
<p>The blockchain stores the settings that specify the permissions, such as roles
and identities, so that all participants in the network can access this
information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="parallel-transaction-execution">
<h3>Parallel Transaction Execution<a class="headerlink" href="#parallel-transaction-execution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most blockchains require serial transaction execution in order to guarantee
consistent ordering at each node on the network. Sawtooth includes an advanced
parallel scheduler that splits transactions into parallel flows. Based on the
locations in state which are accessed by a transaction, Sawtooth isolates the
execution of transactions from one another while maintaining contextual
changes.</p>
<p>When possible, transactions are executed in parallel, while preventing
double-spending even with multiple modifications to the same state. Parallel
scheduling provides a substantial potential increase in performance over
serial execution.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="event-system">
<h3>Event System<a class="headerlink" href="#event-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Hyperledger Sawtooth supports creating and broadcasting events. This allows
applications to:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Subscribe to events that occur related to the blockchain, such as a new
block being committed or switching to a new fork.</p></li>
<li><p>Subscribe to application specific events defined by a transaction family.</p></li>
<li><p>Relay information about the execution of a transaction back to clients
without storing that data in state.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Subscriptions are submitted and serviced over a ZMQ Socket.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ethereum-contract-compatibility-with-seth">
<h3>Ethereum Contract Compatibility with Seth<a class="headerlink" href="#ethereum-contract-compatibility-with-seth" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Sawtooth-Ethereum integration project, Seth, extends the interoperability
of the Sawtooth platform to Ethereum. EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) smart
contracts can be deployed to Sawtooth using the Seth transaction family.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dynamic-consensus">
<span id="dynamic-consensus-label"></span><h3>Dynamic Consensus<a class="headerlink" href="#dynamic-consensus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In a blockchain, consensus is the process of building agreement among a group
of participants in a network. Algorithms for achieving consensus with
arbitrary faults generally require some form of voting among a known set of
participants. General approaches include Nakamoto-style consensus, which
elects a leader through some form of lottery, and variants of the traditional
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance">Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)</a>
algorithms, which use multiple rounds of explicit votes to achieve consensus.</p>
<p>Sawtooth abstracts the core concepts of consensus and isolates consensus from
transaction semantics. The Sawtooth consensus interface supports plugging in
various consensus implementations as <em>consensus engines</em> that interact with the
validator through the <em>consensus API</em>.
More importantly, Sawtooth allows you to change the consensus after the
blockchain network has been created. The consensus algorithm is selected during
the initial network setup and can be changed on a running blockchain with a
transaction or two.</p>
<p>The Sawtooth consensus API supports a wide variety of consensus algorithms on a
network. Sawtooth currently includes consensus engines for these algorithms:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/pbft/nightly/master/">Sawtooth PBFT</a>
(Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) is a voting-based consensus
algorithm that provides Byzantine fault tolerance with finality.
Sawtooth PBFT extends the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/osdi99/full_papers/castro/castro_html/castro.html">original PBFT algorithm</a>
with features such as dynamic network membership, regular view changes,
and a block catch-up procedure. A Sawtooth network with PBFT consensus
requires four or more nodes.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="architecture/poet.html"><span class="doc">PoET</span></a>
(Proof of Elapsed Time) is a Nakamoto-style consensus algorithm that is
designed to be a production-grade protocol capable of supporting large
network populations. PoET relies on secure instruction execution to
achieve the scaling benefits of a Nakamoto-style consensus algorithm
without the power consumption drawbacks of the Proof of Work algorithm.
A Sawtooth network with PoET consensus requires at least three nodes.</p>
<p>Sawtooth includes two versions of PoET consensus:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>PoET-SGX relies on a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), such as
Intel® Software Guard Extensions (SGX), to implement a
leader-election lottery system. PoET-SGX is sometimes called “PoET/BFT”
because it is Byzantine fault tolerant.</p></li>
<li><p>PoET simulator provides PoET-style consensus on any type of hardware,
including a virtualized cloud environment. PoET simulator is also called
“PoET/CFT” because it is crash fault tolerant, not Byzantine fault
tolerant.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-raft">Sawtooth Raft</a>
is a leader-based consensus algorithm that provides crash fault tolerance
for a small network with restricted membership.</p></li>
<li><p>Devmode (short for “developer mode”)
is a simplified random-leader algorithm that is useful for developing and
testing a transaction processor. Devmode is not recommended for
multi-node networks and should not be used for production.</p></li>
</ul>

<span id="sample-transaction-families-label"></span><h3>Sample Transaction Families<a class="headerlink" href="#sample-transaction-families" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In a Sawtooth application, the data model and transaction language are
implemented in a <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-transaction-family"><span class="xref std std-term">transaction family</span></a>, which runs
on a Sawtooth node as a <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-transaction-processor"><span class="xref std std-term">transaction processor</span></a>.</p>
<p>While most application developers will build custom transaction families
that reflect the unique requirements of their ledgers, Sawtooth provides
several core transaction families as models:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>IntegerKey - Used for testing deployed ledgers.</p></li>
<li><p>Settings - Provides a reference implementation for storing
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-on-chain-setting"><span class="xref std std-term">on-chain configuration settings</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Identity - Handles on-chain permissioning for transactor
and validator keys to streamline managing identities
for lists of public keys.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Additional transaction families provide models for specific areas:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Smallbank - Handles performance analysis for benchmarking
and performance testing when comparing the performance of
blockchain systems.
This transaction family is based on the H-Store Smallbank benchmark.</p></li>
<li><p>BlockInfo - Provides a methodology for storing information
about a configurable number of historic blocks.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Other Hyperledger projects provide smart-contract functionality for the Sawtooth
platform:</p>
<blockquote>
