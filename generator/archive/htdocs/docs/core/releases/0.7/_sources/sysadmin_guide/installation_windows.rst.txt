* A progress bar will appear

.. image:: ../images/python_complete.*

* The install is complete! Click Finish.

Install Dependencies
--------------------

We'll need to install a few Python packages using pip.

Open a Powershell window and run the following commmands:

.. code-block:: console

  PS C:\Users\username> c:\python27\scripts\pip.exe install cbor
  PS C:\Users\username> c:\python27\scripts\pip.exe install colorlog
  PS C:\Users\username> c:\python27\scripts\pip.exe install ecdsa
  PS C:\Users\username> c:\python27\scripts\pip.exe install pybitcointools
  PS C:\Users\username> c:\python27\scripts\pip.exe install twisted


Install Validator
=================

You can install SawtoothLake Validator either using the GUI or with an
unattended command line mode. We'll cover both below.

GUI Install
-----------

.. image:: ../images/validator_download_folder.*

* Navigate to the folder containing sawtooth-validator.exe

.. image:: ../images/validator_progress_bar.*

* Double click sawtooth-validator.exe and a window will appear with a
  progress bar

* Click close once the installer finishes

Command Line Install
--------------------

Open Powershell, navigate to the folder containing sawtooth-validator.exe and
start the install

.. code-block:: console

  PS C:\Users\username> cd .\Downloads
  PS C:\Users\username\Downloads> .\sawtooth-validator.exe /S


Whichever way you chose to install, you should now see the Validator
files have been placed in ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\sawtooth-validator``.

.. image:: ../images/validator_files.*

Install As a Service
--------------------

Install the Validator code using either the GUI or command line options above.

* After the install is complete, open a Powershell window and set some 
  system environment variables:

.. code-block:: console

  PS C:\Users\username> [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path",$Env:Path + ";c:\python27;", "Machine")
  PS C:\Users\username> [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PYTHONPATH", "C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\sawtooth-validator\lib\python\", "Machine")

* Rename txnvalidator so Python Extensions can import it:

.. code-block:: console

  PS C:\Users\username> cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\sawtooth-validator\bin"
  PS C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\sawtooth-validator\bin> mv .\txnvalidator .\txnvalidator.py

* Install the Validator sevice:

.. code-block:: console

  PS C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\sawtooth-validator\bin> python.exe .\txnvalidator.py install
  Installing service SawtoothValidator-Service
  Service installed

* Open the Windows services console to verify that the service was installed successfully.

.. code-block:: console

  PS C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\sawtooth-validator\bin> services.msc

.. image:: ../images/services_console.*


Run Validator
=============

The PYTHONPATH environment variable needs to set and the the Python directory
needs to be added to our path before running Validator. Open 
Powershell and run the following:

.. code-block:: console

  PS C:\Users\username> $env:PYTHONPATH += ";C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\sawtooth-validator\lib\python\" 
  PS C:\Users\username> $env:PATH += ";c:\python27;"

Start txnvalidator by navigating to ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\sawtooth-validator\bin``
and running:

.. code-block:: console

  PS C:\Users\username> cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\sawtooth-validator\bin"
  PS C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\sawtooth-validator\bin> python .\txnvalidator --config simple.js --url **none**

You should see the logfiles being updated in 
``C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\sawtooth-validator\logs``.

.. image:: ../images/logfile.*

As a Service
------------

In order to run Validator as a Windows service a few changes need to be made
to the config files.

.. code-block:: console

  PS C:\Users\username> cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\sawtooth-validator\conf"
  PS C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\sawtooth-validator\conf> mv .\simple.js .\settings.js

Open settings.js in your preferred editor and change the "LedgerURL" value to
"\*\*none\*\*":

.. code-block:: none

  {
      "HttpPort" : 0,
      "Host" : "localhost",
      "Port" : 0,
      "NodeName" : "base000",
      "LedgerURL" : "**none**",

The service is set to Manual start by default. Run the below command to start
it:

.. code-block:: console

  PS C:\Users\username> Start-Service SawtoothValidator-Service

Configuring the Validator
=========================

By default, the validator will start up as a 'base' validator.
It will not reach out to other validator nodes, and it will initialize
a new set of data files in the data directory,
`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Intel\\sawtooth-validator\\data\\`
by default.

In order to join the new validator to an existing network of validators,
the "LedgerURL" setting must be changed in the configuration file to
point to a valid URL for an existing http validator in the network.

.. code-block:: none

  {
      "HttpPort" : 0,
      "Host" : "localhost",
      "Port" : 0,
      "NodeName" : "node000",
      "LedgerURL" : "http://base-validator.domain.com:8800/",

It is also important to set the "NodeName" value to a unique value based
on your naming convention. The node's key, which must be generated using
the command *sawtooth keygen*, must be named {node name}.wif and placed 
in the keys directory.

Several other settings are important for correct functionality of the
new validator node. The configuration file must contain the list of
valid transaction families supported by the validator network.

.. code-block:: none

  "TransactionFamilies" : [
      "IntegerKey",
      "MarketPlace"
  ]

Lastly, the "AdministrationNode" setting must contain the address of the
administration node on the validator network. This instructs the validator
to listen for and act on administrative transactions (like shutdown)
received from the administration node. The administration node address
can be found in the keys directory on the adminstration node in a file
called {node name}.addr.

.. code-block:: none

  "AdministrationNode" : "19ns29kWDTX8vNeHNzJbJy6S9HZiqHZyEE"


Security 
--------

You can instruct the validator to check whether or not the validator is being
run under a user with elevated privileges (root in Linux, or administrator in
Windows). If elevated privileges are being used, the validator stops with a
warning.

To run the privilege level check, change the "CheckElevated" setting to "true"
in the configuration file:

.. code-block:: none

  "CheckElevated" : true

This setting applies only to Linux and Windows operating systems.


Uninstallation
==============

Just like with installation, SawtoothLake Validator can be uninstalled
either using the GUI or with an unattended command line mode.

.. note::

  If you installed SawtoothLake Validator as a service, please run the
  service removal commands below before running uninstall.exe

GUI Uninstall
-------------

.. image:: ../images/control_panel.*

* Open the Control Panel and select "Uninstall a Program"

.. image:: ../images/add_remove.*

* Once the Programs and Features Window appears, double click 
  "Intel - sawtoothvalidator - Sawtooth"

.. image:: ../images/validator_uninstall_progress_bar.*

* Click close once the uninstaller finishes

Command Line Uninstall
----------------------

* Open Powershell, navigate to the folder containing uninstaller.exe and
  start the install:

.. code-block:: console

  PS C:\Users\username> cd 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\sawtooth-validator'
  PS C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\sawtooth-validator> .\uninstall.exe /S

However you chose to uninstall, you should now see the Validator
files have been removed from ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\sawtooth-validator``.

You may see some remaining directories. The uninstaller chooses not to remove 
the ``conf``, ``data``, or ``logs`` directories if they aren't empty. You can back up any 
remaining files and remove the leftover directories by hand.

Service removal
---------------

.. code-block:: console

  PS C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\sawtooth-validator\bin> python.exe .\txnvalidator.py remove
  Removing service SawtoothValidator-Service
  Service removed
