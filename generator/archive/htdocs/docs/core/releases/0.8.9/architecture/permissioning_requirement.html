<h1>Permissioning Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#permissioning-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The following is a detailed list of permissioning requirements, capabilities,
and user stories that aid in the explanation and discussion of the
permissioning design for Hyperledger Sawtooth.</p>
<p>The following permission groups are presented in this document:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Transactor key permissioning, which controls acceptance of transactions and
batches based on signing keys.</li>
<li>Validator key permissioning, which controls which nodes are allowed to
establish connections to the validator network.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The permissioning types are further broken down into capability requirements.
Each requirement is made up of a short description, the network scenario the
requirement supports, and associated user stories. User stories are short
statements about a requirement or capability that an actor desires. These short
descriptions illustrate the need for specific permission requirements.</p>
<p>The design requirements for permissioning include both local validator
configuration and network-wide on-chain permissioning. Local configuration is
needed so that a validator can limit who is allowed to submit batches and
transactions directly to that validator. This is useful, for example, if a
company is running its own validator and wishes to only allow members of that
company to submit transactions. On-chain configuration is required so that the
whole of the network can enforce consistent permissioning rules. For example,
in validator key permissioning, all the validators on the network will reject
the same node from peering, ensuring that only known nodes can join the network.</p>

<div class="section" id="general-definitions">
<h3>General Definitions<a class="headerlink" href="#general-definitions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The following define general components and concepts related to Sawtooth:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Batch</dt>
<dd>A batch is a protobuf object containing a list of transactions, a header, and
a signature. The signature is generated by the batch signer by signing the
batch header with the batch signer&#8217;s private key. For more information on the
structure of a batch, see <a class="reference internal" href="transactions_and_batches.html"><span class="doc">Batch Data Structure</span></a>.</dd>
<dt>Transaction</dt>
<dd>A transaction is a protobuf object containing a payload, header, and
signature. The signature is generated by the transaction signer by signing the
transaction header with the transaction signer&#8217;s private key. For more
information on the structure of a transaction, see <a class="reference internal" href="transactions_and_batches.html"><span class="doc">Transaction Data
Structure</span></a>.</dd>
<dt>Consensus</dt>
<dd>Consensus is the process of building agreement among a group of mutually
distrusting participants. In this case, the mutually distrusting participants
are the other nodes on the validator network.</dd>
<dt>Transaction Family</dt>
<dd>A transaction family is a set containing: a transaction payload format, a
model for storing information in global state, and a procedure for validating
a transaction and updating state based on the transaction payload. For
information on specific transaction families, see <a class="reference internal" href="../transaction_family_specifications.html"><span class="doc">Transaction Family
Specifications</span></a>.</dd>
<dt>Transaction Processor</dt>
<dd>A transaction processor validates transactions and updates state based on the
rules defined by a given transaction family.</dd>
<dt>Validator</dt>
<dd>A validator is the component ultimately responsible for validating batches of
transactions, combining them into blocks, maintaining consensus with the
network, and coordinating communication between clients, other validators,
and transaction processors. Much of the actual validation is delegated to
other components, such as transaction processors and the active consensus
module.</dd>
<dt>Node</dt>
<dd>A node is a validator that is trying to connect to the network.</dd>
<dt>Client</dt>
<dd>A client is a program that connects to a validator and is able to query the
state of the blockchain and submit batches.</dd>
<dt>State Delta Subscriber</dt>
<dd>A state delta subscriber is a client framework that subscribes to a validator
for state deltas on a specific subset of namespaces, for the purpose of
off-chain storage or action.</dd>
<dt>Radix Merkle Tree</dt>
<dd>A radix merkle tree is the representation of state used by Sawtooth. The tree
is a merkle tree because it is a copy-on-write data structure which stores
successive node hashes from leaf-to-root upon any changes to the tree. The
tree is also an addressable radix tree because addresses uniquely identify
the paths to leaf nodes in the tree where information is stored.</dd>
<dt>Validator Network</dt>
<dd>A validator network is peer to peer network of validators that are working on
the same block chain.</dd>
<dt>Authorization Procedure</dt>
<dd>An authorization procedure is a “handshake” that a connection must go through
to be allowed to connect to a validator. If the connection does not follow
the authorization procedure correctly, the connection will be rejected and
closed.</dd>
<dt>Policy</dt>
<dd>A policy is a set of DENY and PERMIT rules that can be used to permission the
access to the validator network and which transactors can participate on the
network.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="actor-definitions">
<h3>Actor Definitions<a class="headerlink" href="#actor-definitions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The following define the actors within a Sawtooth network:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Transactor</dt>
<dd>A transactor is the person or program which signs batches or transactions.
When signing a batch, the transactor is also a batch signer. When signing a
transaction, a transactor is also a transaction signer.</dd>
<dt>Batch Signer</dt>
<dd>A batch signer is a transactor which signs a batch header using the batch
signer&#8217;s private key. The resulting signature is included as part of the
batch. The batch signer&#8217;s public key is also stored in the batch header.</dd>
<dt>Transaction Signer</dt>
<dd>A transaction signer is a transactor which signs a transaction header using
the transaction signer&#8217;s private key. The resulting signature is included as
part of the transaction. The transaction signer&#8217;s public key is also
stored in the transaction header.</dd>
<dt>Network Operator</dt>
<dd>A network operator is one or more people who collectively manage the sawtooth
network. The network operator determines and coordinates the overall network
characteristics such as which transaction processors are being run, the
consensus mechanism, modifying on-chain settings, modifying on-chain roles etc.</dd>
<dt>Sysadmin</dt>
<dd>A sysadmin is a person who installs and configures the validator software
and configures the validator software using config files. The role of
sysadmin does not include activities which modify on-chain settings.</dd>
</dl>

</div>
<div class="section" id="validator-network-scenarios">
<h2>Validator Network Scenarios<a class="headerlink" href="#validator-network-scenarios" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following example network scenarios are used to illustrate when each
capability requirement would be useful.</p>
<div class="section" id="public-network">
<h3>Public Network<a class="headerlink" href="#public-network" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In a public network, all connections will be allowed and all transactors are
allowed to sign batches and transactions.</p>
<p>In order for a public Sawtooth network to function correctly, an incentive
system would also need to be designed and implemented. Such a system is beyond
the scope of this design and so it is omitted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="consortium-network">
<h3>Consortium Network<a class="headerlink" href="#consortium-network" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In a consortium network, only specific validators will be allowed to join the
validator network and participate in consensus. The network will still allow
any client, transaction processor, or state delta subscriber to connect to a
validator and accept batches and transactions signed by all transactors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="private-network">
<h3>Private Network<a class="headerlink" href="#private-network" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In a private network, only specific validators will be allowed to join the
validator network and participate in consensus. The validators in the network
will only accept connections from specific clients and will control if the
client is allowed to submit batches and query specific address prefixes. in
state. Only specific transaction processors and state delta subscribers will be
allowed to connect to the local validator. Batches and transactions received by
the validator can only be signed by permitted transactors. Transactors may also
be restricted to only sending transactions for certain transaction families.</p>

<p>The following stories are related to permissioning performed on the basis of a

transaction signers. The validator will check local configuration and network
