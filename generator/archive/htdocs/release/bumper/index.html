  </header>
  <section class="post-content"><p><a href="top"></a></p>

<p>Hyperledger Sawtooth 1.1 (Bumper) is now available. See the
<a href="https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/1.1.5/">documentation</a> to
get started.</p>

<p>This page describes the new and changed features in Hyperledger
Sawtooth 1.1 (since release 1.0). Information is organized in the following
categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#core-sawtooth-components">Core Sawtooth Components</a></li>
  <li><a href="#consensus">Consensus</a>: Includes the new consensus API, changes to existing
consensus algorithm implementations, and support for new consensus algorithms</li>
  <li><a href="#documentation">Documentation</a></li>
  <li><a href="#smart-contract-engines">Smart Contract Engines</a></li>
  <li><a href="#devops-and-ci">DevOps and CI</a>: Describes changes to the project’s build
tools and continuous integration process</li>
  <li><a href="#website">Website</a>: Includes the Sawtooth website content, structure, and
website development processes</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="core-sawtooth-components">Core Sawtooth Components</h1>

<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The consensus API has been completely redesigned. Consensus has been moved to
a separate process, called a “consensus engine”. See <a href="#consensus">Hyperledger Sawtooth
Consensus</a> for more details.</li>
  <li>State pruning is now supported at a configurable block horizon. This helps
limit the total storage requirements for global state by removing historic
state after the configured horizon. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-rfcs/pull/8">state pruning
RFC</a> for more details.</li>
  <li>Several example transaction processors have been rewritten in Rust, including
IntegerKey (intkey), XO, and Smallbank.</li>
  <li>A new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/status</code> endpoint and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sawtooth status show</code> command are available to
query status information for an active validator.</li>
  <li>New metrics have been added for submitted batches and transactions, thread
pools, transaction processing, and dispatcher queue sizes.</li>
  <li>The internal metrics library has been refactored to be more modular and
similar to the logging API.</li>
  <li>The gossip protocol used by Sawtooth is now versioned to support
backwards-compatible upgrades in the future.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="major-improvements">Major Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The Rust SDK has matured. It now includes libraries for signing, writing
transaction processors, and writing consensus engines, along with supporting
information for the auto-generated SDK documentation.</li>
  <li>Several key items have been rewritten in Rust: Validator CLI argument
parsing, global state database (and supporting views), ChainController, and
BlockPublisher. This change allows some code to be executed outside of the
Python global interpreter lock (GIL).</li>
  <li>The ChainController and BlockPublisher have been substantially refactored to
be more modular and support validating blocks in parallel.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="minor-improvements">Minor Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Transaction processors can now report the maximum number of transactions that
they can handle at a time. The validator will only request that many
transactions at a time for processing.</li>
  <li>Logging has been improved to reduce the volume and improve the quality of
generated log messages.</li>
  <li>Discarded blocks are now explicitly canceled to avoid wasting effort on
blocks that will never be chosen.</li>
  <li>Deserialization is now cached for messages that have multiple handlers to
avoid redundant work.</li>
  <li>Peers are requested only from connections that have passed authorization.</li>
  <li>Client message handling has been moved to a separate thread pool to avoid
interfering with transaction processing.</li>
  <li>The parallel scheduler has been refactored to use a generic <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PredecessorTree</code>
data structure.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bad internal configuration that allowed the Completer and
ChainController to get out of sync about which blocks were in the system</li>
  <li>Add missing handlers for client messages</li>
  <li>Correctly decrement “time to live” on gossip messages</li>
  <li>Handled an edge case where a new node will not get the chain until a new
block is published</li>
  <li>Stopped trying to unschedule transactions that haven’t been scheduled yet</li>
  <li>Fixed a number of concurrency issues where data structure were being accessed
concurrently without protection or with incorrect usage of synchronization
primitives</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where a future could be executed in the event loop instead of in
a thread pool</li>
  <li>Only broadcast to peers that have completed authorization</li>
  <li>Ensured that candidate blocks are only built in the BlockPublisher thread</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="upgrade-considerations">Upgrade Considerations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The consensus setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sawtooth.consensus.algorithm</code> setting has been
deprecated and no longer has an effect. Instead, use the settings
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sawtooth.consensus.algorithm.name</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sawtooth.consensus.algorithm.version</code>
to set the name and version of the consensus engine.</li>
  <li>All SDKs except Rust and Python have been moved from sawtooth-core to
<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=sawtooth-sdk&amp;type=&amp;language=">separate repositories</a>.</li>
  <li>PoET has been moved to <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-poet">a new repository</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">&gt; back to top &lt;</a></p>

<h1 id="consensus">Consensus</h1>

<p>Hyperledger Sawtooth 1.1 includes a new consensus interface that enables
features like language independence for consensus algorithms. Consensus
protocols are now implemented as separate processes called “consensus engines”,
which enables more consensus options for Sawtooth. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-rfcs/pull/4">consensus API
RFC</a> for more details.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The network deployment tools have been updated to launch the consensus
processes. If you have made your own custom launch scripts, note that the
consensus engine now runs as its own process, like other services such as the
REST API and transaction processors. Please see the example Sawtooth
docker-compose files for reference.</li>
  <li>This release includes the following consensus engines based on the new
consensus API:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-poet">PoET consensus engine</a>, a
refactored version of the previous PoET consensus module.</li>
      <li>Dev mode consensus engine, based on the previous dev mode consensus module.</li>
      <li>New <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-pbft">PBFT consensus engine</a>,
based on the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm.</li>
      <li>New <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-raft">Raft consensus engine</a>,
based on the Raft consensus algorithm.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sawtooth-poet">Sawtooth PoET</h2>

<p>The Sawtooth Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) consensus can be deployed as a pure
Python application using a simulated enclave, called PoET simulator, or with a
C++ module implementing an Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX)
enclave, called PoET-SGX.</p>

<ul>
  <li>PoET simulator is available in the 1.1 release as a consensus engine. If you
are using PoET simulator consensus, we recommend upgrading to Sawtooth 1.1.</li>
  <li>PoET-SGX has not been validated on Sawtooth 1.1. Users relying on PoET-SGX
are recommended to remain on Sawtooth 1.0. We are working on a new
implementation of poet and its TEE enclave, which is anticipated for a point
release in the near future.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sawtooth-raft">Sawtooth Raft</h2>

<p>Hyperledger Sawtooth 1.1 supports a developer preview of <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-raft">Sawtooth
Raft</a>, a Rust implementation of
Raft based on the <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/raft-rs">raft-rs</a> library used by
<a href="https://github.com/tikv/tikv">TiKV</a>. The Sawtooth Raft consensus engine uses
the new consensus API.</p>

<p>Sawtooth Raft is still in the prototype phase and is under active development.</p>

<h2 id="sawtooth-pbft">Sawtooth PBFT</h2>

<p>The Hyperledger Sawtooth 1.1 release includes the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-pbft">Sawtooth PBFT consensus
engine</a>. Sawtooth PBFT is based
on the <a href="http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf">original PBFT paper</a> with
several extensions to make it compatible with Sawtooth and to resolve known
issues with the original protocol. See the RFCs for more details:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-rfcs/pull/19">Initial RFC</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-rfcs/pull/29">Extension RFC to mitigate fair ordering and silent leader issues</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-rfcs/pull/30">Extension RFC to enable observer validation of consensus</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Sawtooth PBFT is still in the prototype phase and is under active development.</p>

<h1 id="smart-contract-engines">Smart Contract Engines</h1>

<h2 id="sawtooth-seth">Sawtooth Seth</h2>

<p>Hyperledger Sawtooth 1.1 continues to support <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth">Sawtooth
Seth</a>, an Ethereum-compatible
transaction family for the Hyperledger Sawtooth platform. Significant changes
in this release:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">seth</code> CLI that is capable of communicating with the existing JSON-RPC
API. This CLI will let us test the JSON-RPC API, and will eventually allow us
to deprecate the existing REST-API-based CLI, which is now available in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">seth-cli-go</code> container.</li>
  <li>The existing JSON-RPC API has been updated to align more closely with
existing Ethereum JSON-RPC implementations, particularly in how it handles
account management. This change provides better inter-compatibility with
off-the-shelf Ethereum tooling.</li>
  <li>The Burrow version was updated from 0.17 to 0.21 and vendor dependencies were
removed.</li>
  <li>The build process and dependencies have been updated and aligned with current
best practices, such as formatting the Rust code and linting it with Clippy.</li>
  <li>The documentation has been updated with minor corrections.</li>
  <li>Several minor bugs have been fixed, such as a segfault occurring when
creating an account with a nonce, and invalid addresses being displayed in
contract listing.</li>
  <li>This release includes Dockerfiles suitable for publishing to Docker Hub.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sawtooth-sabre">Sawtooth Sabre</h2>

<p>Hyperledger Sawtooth 1.1 supports <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sabre">Sawtooth
Sabre</a>, a transaction family
that implements on-chain smart contracts executed in a WebAssembly virtual
machine. Sabre smart contracts are stored on chain and executed using the Sabre
transaction processor.</p>

<p>Sawtooth Sabre includes an SDK for writing Sabre smart contracts in Rust. The
smart contracts can be written in such a way that they can be compiled into
transaction processor and run without Sabre. This also makes it easy to convert
already-written Rust transaction processors to a Sabre smart contract.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Sabre is currently at version 0.1 and is under active development.</p>

<p><a href="#top">&gt; back to top &lt;</a></p>

<h1 id="devops-and-ci">DevOps and CI</h1>

<h2 id="build-system-improvements">Build System Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin/build_all</code> script and related build scripts have been replaced with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker-compose</code>.</li>
  <li>The Docker Compose files now have ‘build’ sections, so that pre-building
steps aren’t necessary and all required images can be built with a single
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker-compose up</code> command.</li>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sawtooth-dev-{lang}</code> Dockerfiles are deprecated. Each component now has
its own Dockerfile for development.</li>
</ul>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-rfcs/pull/25">build system
RFC</a> for more details.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Requires Docker Engine 18.02.0 or later.</p>

<h2 id="docker">Docker</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Each component now has “installed” Dockerfiles that utilize multi-stage
builds. These Dockerfiles are suitable for publishing to a docker registry.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Requires Docker Engine 18.02.0 or later.</p>

<h2 id="kubernetes">Kubernetes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>This release includes example files for two Kubernetes deployments: A
five-node network using PoET simulator and a single-node environment using
dev mode consensus. The Application Developer’s Guide describes how to use
these example files; see the <a href="https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/1.1.5/app_developers_guide.html">Hyperledger Sawtooth
documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">&gt; back to top &lt;</a></p>

<h1 id="website">Website</h1>

<p>The Sawtooth website,
<a href="https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org">sawtooth.hyperledger.org</a>, has been updated
with this release. This update includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A new home page for Hyperledger Sawtooth that provides links to examples,
documentation, and timely blog posts.</li>
  <li>The structure to easily update static content and blog posts.</li>
  <li>The ability to conduct agile changes, reviews, and approvals through Github.</li>
</ul>

<p>Expect changes to the Sawtooth website on a regular basis. In the short term,
we plan to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improve website navigation</li>
  <li>Automate the website build and deployment, based on the model for Sawtooth</li>
  <li>Apply consistent formatting throughout the site
PRs</li>
</ul>
