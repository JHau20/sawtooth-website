<p>Hyperledger Sawtooth 1.2 (Chime) is now available.  See the <a href="https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/1.2.3/">latest
documentation</a> to
get started.</p>

<p>This page describes the new and changed features in Hyperledger Sawtooth 1.2
(since release 1.1).  Information is organized in the following categories:</p>

<h1 id="hyperledger-sawtooth-12">Hyperledger Sawtooth 1.2</h1>

<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Support for <a href="https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/pbft/releases/1.0.1/">Sawtooth PBFT consensus engine version
1.0</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Sawtooth PBFT is the recommended consensus mechanism. It is designed to
handle small to medium network sizes with finality and byzantine fault
tolerance.</li>
      <li>Sawtooth PoET is designed for larger networks at the expense of slower /
probabilistic finality.</li>
      <li>Sawtooth Raft is designed for small to medium networks but performs more
slowly than Sawtooth PBFT and lacks byzantine fault tolerance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mobile SDKs for iOS (Swift) and Android (as part of the Java SDK).
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sdk-swift">Sawtooth SDK Swift</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sdk-java">Sawtooth SDK Java</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Support for raw transaction headers, as specified in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-rfcs/blob/master/text/0023-raw-txn-header.md">Sawtooth RFC
#23</a>.
This feature is backward compatible via the use of a protocol version indicator.</li>
  <li>All core transaction families are compatible with <a href="https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/sabre/releases/0.4.0/">Sawtooth Sabre release
0.4</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="non-breaking-changes">Non-breaking changes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>PoET has the following patches:
    <ul>
      <li>Resolve a security defect where a correctly admitted validator could game
its wait times. Thanks to Huibo Wang, Guoxing Chen, Yinqian Zhang,
and Zhiqiang Lin for analyzing the poet implementation and identifying the
defect.</li>
      <li>Support the updated attestation service API</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A new BlockManager has been implemented, as specified in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-rfcs/pull/5">Sawtooth RFC
#5</a>. This new feature
improves block management and helps remove a known race condition that can cause
network nodes to fork.</li>
  <li>Several core transaction families have been rewritten in Rust: Settings,
Identity, and BlockInfo.</li>
  <li>All SDKs are in separate repositories for improved build time and release
scheduling. The following SDKs were moved to their own repositories in this
release:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sdk-go">hyperledger/sawtooth-sdk-go</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sdk-python">hyperledger/sawtooth-sdk-python</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sdk-rust">hyperledger/sawtooth-sdk-rust</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Devmode consensus engine has been moved to a separate repository:
<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-devmode">hyperledger/sawtooth-devmode</a>.</li>
  <li>Consensus support has been modified to improve compatibility with PBFT
consensus.</li>
  <li>Cache performance has been improved for settings and identity state.</li>
  <li>Duplicate signature validations have been eliminated.</li>
  <li>Duplicate batches are now removed from the pending queue and candidate blocks</li>
  <li>Transaction processors now receive a registration ACK before receiving
transaction process requests.</li>
  <li>Long-lived futures are expired when awaiting network message replies.</li>
  <li>Logs now have fewer duplicate log messages.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="documentation-changes">Documentation changes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Improved summary of the supported consensus algorithms: PBFT, PoET, Raft, and
Devmode. See

changing network membership. For procedures to configure either PBFT or PoET
 consensus, see:</li>
