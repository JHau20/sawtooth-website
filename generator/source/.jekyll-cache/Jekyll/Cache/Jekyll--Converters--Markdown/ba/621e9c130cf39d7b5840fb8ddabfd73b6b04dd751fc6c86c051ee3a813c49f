<p>We strongly believe in helping organizations and developers overcome obstacles
to blockchain adoption by investing in training and certification courses for
Hyperledger. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re thrilled to announce that Certified Hyperledger
Fabric Administrator and Certified Hyperledger Sawtooth Administrator exams will
be released later this year!</p>

<p>Below is more information on the certification exams:</p>

<p>Certified Hyperledger Fabric Administrator</p>

<p>The Certified Hyperledger Fabric Administrator (CHFA) can effectively build a
secure Hyperledger Fabric network for commercial deployment. To pass the exam,
professionals must demonstrate the ability to install, configure, operate,
manage, and troubleshoot the nodes on that network. Completion of LFD271 may
help serve as preparation for the CHFA exam, but is not required.</p>
